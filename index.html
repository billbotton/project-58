    <h1> My Favourite Hobby :<br><span><br>Drawing</span></h1>
    <div class="div"></div>
      <p id="para1">My hobby is drawing,  realistic sketches and I also like to draw simple and hilarious cartoon doodles, in my free time. I like to draw small doodles during the school week and on weekends,for an hour, I draw something. Research has shown that drawing helps improve your memory , makes us think creatively,<br>helps establish concentration and <br>helps with problem solving questions. </p>
